Short for compare and contrast, this is a repo that helps you rapidly build a full-stack application using NextJS, TailwindCSS, and leverages Google-Sheets as a back-end/CMS.

## To-Do Roadmap

[x] - Set up NextJS with TailwindCSS
[] - Google Sheets Integration (WIP)
    [x] - Read Data
    [] - Create Data
    [] - Update Data
    [] - Delete Data
[] - User Authentication/Authorization
    [] - Let authenticated users perform CRUD


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy this app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
